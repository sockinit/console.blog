# console.blog

## What?
An updatable blog that allows for adding new, editing and deleting posts.

## Why?
To get familiar with using Hapi with Handlebars in a modularised format.

## How?
* A Redis database to store blog posts and admin users.
* SASS to decorate the front-end.
* Hapi to serve from the back-end.
* Plug-in file formatting for handlers.
* Handlebars templating in the html.
